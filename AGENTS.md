- we are using "ddev" in dev environment
- always use "bin/kickstart.sh" to rebuild the database during the current project phase
- we are using asset mapper
- since we code in dev environment there is no need to run the asset-map:compile command
- we are using easyadmin version 4
- please interact with the easyadmin code base and watch easyadmins own state management
- dont run any migrations in current dev phase, since we are re-creating the database each time
