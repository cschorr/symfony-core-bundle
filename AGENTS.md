- we are using Docker Compose in dev environment  
- always use "bin/kickstart.sh" to rebuild the database during the current project phase
- we are using Symfony Asset Mapper (not Webpack Encore)
- since we code in dev environment there is no need to run the asset-map:compile command
- this is an API-first application using API Platform without admin interface
- please interact with API Platform resources, GraphQL/REST endpoints, and JWT authentication
- dont run any migrations in current dev phase, since we are re-creating the database each time
